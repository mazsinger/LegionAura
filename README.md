**An open-source RGB keyboard lighting controller for Lenovo LOQ, Legion, and IdeaPad Gaming laptops on Linux.**

LegionAura provides full control over the built-in 4-zone RGB ITE keyboard without requiring Lenovo Vantage or Windows. It is lightweight, fast, and designed to work entirely through USB HID control transfers, replicating the behavior of Lenovo’s firmware-level lighting commands.

## Why LegionAura Exists

Lenovo does not officially provide Linux support for multi-zone RGB keyboard lighting on LOQ/Legion/IdeaPad gaming laptops.

Most devices expose only raw HID/USB interfaces with undocumented control packets. LegionAura implements a clean, fully-open library and CLI based on reverse-engineering and community research.

The goal is to provide:
* A stable command-line controller
* A reusable C++ library
* A GUI that mirrors Lenovo Vantage’s lighting controls
* Support for multiple Lenovo gaming models

---

## Supported Devices

All laptops using the **ITE 8295 RGB controller** over USB HID are supported.

While the tool should be compatible with a wide range of Lenovo gaming laptops, it has been tested and confirmed to work with the following models:

* **Legion Series (2020-2024)**
    * Legion Pro
    * Legion Regular/Slim
* **LOQ Series (2023-2024)**
* **IdeaPad Gaming Series (2021-2022)**

A more detailed list of models includes:
- Legion Pro (2024)
- Legion Regular/Slim (2024)
- Lenovo LOQ (2024)
- Legion Pro (2023)
- Legion Slim (2023)
- Lenovo LOQ (2023)
- Legion Pro/Regular (2022)
- IdeaPad Gaming (2022)
- Legion Pro/Regular (2021)
- IdeaPad Gaming (2021)
- Legion Pro/Regular (2020)

If your device is not on this list but uses an ITE 8295 controller, it will likely work. You can contribute by adding your device's PID to `devices/devices.json` and submitting a pull request.

## How It Works

LegionAura communicates with the keyboard’s ITE controller using a single USB `SET_REPORT` control transfer.

---

## Getting Started

There are two ways to install LegionAura: through an AUR helper (for Arch-based distributions) or by building it manually.

### Installation from AUR (Arch Linux)

If you are on Arch Linux or an Arch-based distribution, you can install LegionAura from the [Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/legionaura-git).

Use your favorite AUR helper.

**Using `yay`:**
```bash
yay -S legionaura
```

**Using `paru`:**
```bash
paru -S legionaura
```

The package will automatically handle dependencies, build the project, and install it to your system.

### ✅ Method 2 — Build Manually (Any Linux Distribution)

If you are not on an Arch-based distribution or prefer to build the project yourself, follow these steps.

**1. Install Dependencies**

First, you need to install the required build tools and libraries.

*   **A C++17 compatible compiler:** `gcc` or `clang`
*   **CMake:** Version 3.16 or later
*   **libusb:** Version 1.0 or later
*   **Qt6:** For the GUI
*   **Git:** To clone the repository

On **Debian/Ubuntu-based** distributions, you can install them with:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev qt6-base-dev git
```

On **Fedora/RHEL-based** distributions, you can install them with:
```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo dnf install cmake libusb1-devel qt6-qtbase-devel git
```

**2. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nivedck/LegionAura.git
cd LegionAura
```

**3. Build and Install**

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

This will compile the project and install the `legionaura` executable to `/usr/local/bin` and the GUI to `/usr/local/bin/legionaura-gui`, making it available system-wide.

**4. Set Up udev Rules**

To allow LegionAura to access the keyboard without running it as root, you need to install a `udev` rule. This gives your user account permission to control the device.

```bash
sudo cp ../udev/10-legionaura.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

After this, unplug and reconnect your keyboard (or reboot your system) for the changes to take full effect. You can now run `legionaura` as a regular user.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If LegionAura fails to work after installation, follow these diagnostic steps:

### 1. Check if your device is recognized

Run:
```bash
lsusb | grep 048d
```

You should see a line like:
```
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 048d:c975 ITE Tech. ITE Device(...)
```

If you see nothing, your keyboard may not be connected or recognized by the system.

**What to do:**
- Ensure the keyboard is plugged in or powered on
- Try a different USB port
- Check `lsusb -v` for more details

### 2. Verify the device PID is in the udev rule

Check your device's product ID (PID) from the `lsusb` output above (the last 4 hex digits, e.g., `c975`).

Verify it's listed in `/etc/udev/rules.d/10-legionaura.rules`:
```bash
grep "c975" /etc/udev/rules.d/10-legionaura.rules
```

If your PID is **not** in the rule, you have two options:
- **Add it manually:** Edit the file and add a line like:
  ```bash
  SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="048d", ATTR{idProduct}=="c975", MODE="0666"
  ```
  Then reload rules (see step 4 below) and [open an issue](https://github.com/nivedck/LegionAura/issues) so we can add it to the repository.

- **Or use the generic catch-all rule** (less safe but works for any ITE device):
  ```bash
  sudo sed -i 's/^# SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="048d", MODE="0666"/SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="048d", MODE="0666"/' /etc/udev/rules.d/10-legionaura.rules
  ```

### 3. Check device permissions

Find your device's bus and device numbers from `lsusb` (e.g., `Bus 001 Device 005`), then run:
```bash
ls -l /dev/bus/usb/001/005
```

You should see `rw` permissions for your user. Example of correct permissions:
```
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 189, 4 Nov 16 10:30 /dev/bus/usb/001/005
```

If permissions show `rw----` or `r--r--r--`, the udev rule is not applied.

### 4. Reload and trigger udev rules

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

Then **unplug and replug your keyboard** (or reboot). Permissions should update automatically.

### 5. Monitor udev events (optional)

To see live udev activity while you plug/unplug the keyboard:
```bash
sudo udevadm monitor --udev &
# Then unplug and replug your keyboard
```

You should see events like:
```
UDEV  [xxx] add      /devices/pci0000:00/.../usb1/1-1 (usb)
```

### 6. Test as root (to confirm device-level functionality)

If udev permissions are still problematic, test with `sudo` to rule out permission issues:
```bash
sudo legionaura --version
sudo legionaura static ff0000
```

If this works but non-root doesn't, the issue is definitely permissions (udev rule).

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Device open failed` when run as non-root | Udev rule not applied or PID mismatch | Check steps 2–4 above |
| `Device open failed` even with `sudo` | Device not found by libusb | Check step 1; ensure keyboard is connected |
| `Failed to claim USB interface` | Another program is using the device | Close other RGB software; check `lsof /dev/bus/usb/...` |
| Udev rule applied but still no access | User not in required group (if using `GROUP="plugdev"`) | Run `groups` to check; add user with `sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER` and re-login |

### Still not working?

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/nivedck/LegionAura/issues) with:
1. Output of `lsusb | grep 048d`
2. Output of `cat /etc/udev/rules.d/10-legionaura.rules`
3. Output of `ls -l /dev/bus/usb/BUS/DEV` (replace `BUS`/`DEV` with your numbers)
4. Whether `sudo legionaura` works
